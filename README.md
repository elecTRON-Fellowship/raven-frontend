## 💬 Conversations and Chats

Send and receive messages and have conversations with your contacts. Exchange messages in real-time. Seamless chat experience with read receipts.

## ☕ Coffee Break

Have a time-bound 10-minute conversation when you’re running short on time. Coffee break allows you to have short conversations without losing track of time and saves you from lengthy goodbyes. Messages exchanged during a Coffee Break disappear after 10 minutes.

## 🎫 Tickets

Running short on cash? Let your trusted friends help you out. Raise a ticket and ask your close friends to help you out by sending you money. Ask from only the people you trust and return the favour by contributing to a friend’s ticket.

## 📍 Places

Looking for places to hang out with your friends? Choose nearby locations based on rating, distance and by looking at images. Book a cab and invite one or more of your close friends to let them contribute to the fare ticket. Splitting the cab fare has never been easier.
